#Create a class named Car that has the following attributes
    #Year - Year the car was manufactured
    #Make - Maker of the car
    #Speed - Current speed of the car
#Constructor
    #The constructor should accept the car's year and make. The speed should be set to zero.
#Methods
    #Accelerate - Adds the value to the cars current speed
    #Brake - Subtract the value from the cars current speed (don't go below zero)
#The first record in the 10.03 Cars.txt contains the year and the make. Instantiate one car object with this data.
#The rest of the 10.03 Cars.txt contains acceleration and brake information.
    #If the number is greater than zero, call the Accelerate method to add that amount of speed to the car.
    #If the number is less that zero. call the Brake method to subtract that amount of speed from the car.
#Print the change of speed value and the current speed value
